                About Me
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                I am a pet lover and I have adopted one dog, Meimei, and five cats: Milu, Mini, Mihua, Michi, and Miso. All of my cats were living on the street, and somehow they liked to follow Meimei while we were walking around. As a result, they are now in-door cat. Albeit all my cats keep destroying things around my house or even peeing on my bed four times a week, I still love them.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I graduated from UCSB in Statistics and Data Science in 2021 and immediately joined the UCR CS department for graduate school. Currently, I am conducting research in the finance, power market. I have also started the MAS program from UCLA in Fall 2023. Once I finish all of my degrees, I will be searching for opportunities in quantitative research, quantitative trading, data science, or machine learning engineering.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                For the past few years, I have been actively involved in research in the power market and teaching young students various subjects: such as C++, Python, AMC, USACO, and AI classes. In addition, I have been creating packages that perform mean-variance analysis that utilizes Monte Carlo simulation. Meanwhile, I am actively conducting research in the Fama French Factor Model incorporating Conditional Value at Risk to generate acceptable alpha and trading strategies. Besides researching finance, I am also interested in applying novel machine-learning techniques in animal lab work. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Lastly, my ultimate life goal is to build my hedge fund empire that supports my animal trusted fund so that animals can receive advanced and immediate treatment when needed.
